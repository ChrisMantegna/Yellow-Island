Intertidal Monitoring on Yellow Island 
Notes on Data Files
YellowPA .csv
•	Present / Not Present will be coded
o	1 – Present
o	0 – Not Present
•	Abundance will be coded
o	1 – Rare
o	2 – Occasional
o	3 – Common
o	4 – Abundant
•	Modifiers will be coded
o	0.25 – Locally common
o	0.50 – Locally abundant
•	Zonation
o	1 – Upper
o	2 – Middle
o	3 – Lower
o	0 – Not applicable (used in the Zonation column on the abundance counts since zonation doesn’t matter here)

Quadrat .csv
•	All quadrats are 0.5 x 0.5 meter squares
•	2 quadrats were taken together sharing an interior boundary to form a 1 meter width area for sampling at recorded GPS location within the site
•	3 categories for evaluation
o	Substrate/ Algal Cover
o	Counted Species
o	% Cover Species

 
NOTES
•	All quadrats require list of algae, barnacle, type along with % cover
•	All highly abundant species (i.e., Nucella) can be ‘counted’ in percentage within a specific area and then extrapolated into the full quadrat abundance
•	GPS Coordinates should be taken  at the Top Left and Bottom Right corners
•	Recording the quadrat counts several categories were collapsed into one general category
•	Consistency in recording is paramount – must have
o	Time
o	Date
o	Collector name
o	Site number
o	Tidal zonation 
o	Fill in all blanks with a value – 0 is a value, N/A is also a value
