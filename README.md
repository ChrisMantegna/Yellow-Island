#### Notes on Data Files

**YellowPA.csv**
* Present / Not Present will be coded
  * 1 – Present
  * 0 – Not Present
*	Abundance will be coded
  * 1 – Rare
  * 2 – Occasional
  * 3 – Common
  * 4 – Abundant
* Modifiers will be coded
  * 0.25 – Locally common
  * 0.50 – Locally abundant
* Zonation
  * 1 – Upper
  * 2 – Middle
  * 3 – Lower
  * 0 – Not applicable (used in the Zonation column on the abundance counts since zonation doesn’t matter here)

**Quadrat.csv**
* All quadrats are 0.5 x 0.5 meter squares
* 2 quadrats were taken together sharing an interior boundary to form a 1 meter width area for sampling at recorded GPS location within the site
3 categories for evaluation
  * Substrate/ Algal Cover
  * Counted Species
  * % Cover Species

 
**NOTES**
* All quadrats require list of algae, barnacle, type along with % cover
* All highly abundant species (i.e., Nucella) can be ‘counted’ in percentage within a specific area and then extrapolated into the full quadrat abundance
* GPS Coordinates should be taken  at the Top Left and Bottom Right corners
* Recording the quadrat counts several categories were collapsed into one general category
* Consistency in recording is paramount – must have
  * Time
  * Date
  * Collector name
  * Site number
  * Tidal zonation 
  * Fill in all blanks with a value – 0 is a value, N/A is also a value
